For the first two parts of the project, the input data files provided have the traditional role. It's provided two data-sets, one for training and one for testing. 
The main goal was to predict y_test based on x_test, while the model was already trained by the data-sets x_train and respective y_train. 

In the third part of the project, it was introduced an unlabeled data-set "x_train1_extra" to introduce pseudo-labeling to the project. 

For the last part of the project, the data-sets were provided in two different formats. In the first format (format a), for each pixel, the set of pixels in a 7x7 neighborhood surrounding are given as features.
In the second format (format b) the entire input and corresponding segmentation images are given and can be used in a structured prediction task.
