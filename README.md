Machine Learning for Regression, Classification, and Segmentation

This project explores multiple Machine Learning techniques applied to regression, classification, and segmentation tasks. Implemented using Python with TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy, the project consists of four key components:

Regression with Outlier Detection: Multiple linear regression with Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regularization was used, to predict toxic algae concentrations in water. Outlier removal was optimized through an iterative process. Implemented on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
Time-Series Forecasting with ARX Model: Developed an AutoRegressive model with Exogenous inputs (ARX) to enhance algae concentration prediction, integrating past values and optimizing hyperparameters via cross-validation. Implemented on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
Image Classification (Crater Detection): Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify satellite images of craters, outperforming an SVM approach. Data augmentation techniques were used to address class imbalance. Implemented on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
Image Segmentation (Crater Masking): Implemented a UNet-based segmentation model to label crater regions in images. Weighted Dice loss, binary cross-entropy, and class balancing techniques were used, to improve accuracy. Implemented on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

This project showcases experience with machine learning pipelines, data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation, providing a strong foundation in AI-driven applications.

Both software are similar and the entire project was programmed in Python. The main difference in the code is how the data files, in which the models are trained, are uploaded.
